    <!-- Goals Section -->
    <section class="container mx-auto my-6 rounded border border-black bg-white p-4">
      <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-red-800">Goals</h2>
      <h3 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Goal 1: Learn how Agile teams operate by participating in at least 90% of stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. Focus on understanding task breakdown, estimation, and iterative development </h3>
      <p>I have attended all the stand-ups, backlog refinement meetings, and sprint planning sessions so far. As a result, I’ve learned a lot about how Agile teams operate specifically in task breakdown, estimation, and iterative development. These experiences have deepened my understanding of Agile workflows.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Goal 2:  Learn the fundamentals of React by building and debugging at least 3 React components and implement Redux for global state management in at least 5 or more features. </h3>
      <p>I’ve implemented several frontend features using React and have built and debugged multiple components. This process has significantly improved my understanding of React fundamentals. I’ve also gained hands-on experience with Redux for managing global state across features.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Goal 3: Learn how to develop and optimize at least 3 API endpoints using Node.js and gain an understanding of Datadog by setting up monitors for at least 5 key metrics to track API reliability. </h3>
      <p>I’ve developed an API endpoint that implements a soft delete feature of files from GCP buckets. While I’ve started working on the backend, I still need to explore Datadog further. Setting up monitors for key metrics is an area I plan to focus on next.</p>


    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section class="container mx-auto my-6 rounded border border-black bg-white p-4">
      <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-red-800">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In summary, I’ve gained a solid understanding of Agile principles by actively participating in team ceremonies. I’ve built numerous features using React and strengthened my backend development skills through hands-on experience. These skills will be invaluable in my future projects and career growth.</p>
