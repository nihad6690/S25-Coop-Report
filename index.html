    <!-- Job Description Section -->
    <section class="container mx-auto my-6 rounded border border-black bg-white p-4">
      <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-red-800">Job Description</h2>
      <p>The use of ChatGPT in computer science education is a topic that can be viewed from both positive and negative perspectives. This project aims to investigate the following with SoCS students and faculty as the focus:</p>
      <ul class="mt-3 list-disc pl-5">
        <li><strong>Is ChatGPT a boon or bane for computer science students?</strong> This part investigates whether computer science students should be allowed to use tools such as ChatGPT for course assessments such as labs and assignments. If allowed, how can students use it responsibly and ethically, avoiding traps such as plagiarism?</li>
        <li class="mt-2"><strong>Is ChatGPT a boon or bane for computer science professors?</strong> This part investigates whether and how tools such as ChatGPT can complement teaching practices and how professors can conveniently integrate these tools into their curriculum.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Goals Section -->
    <section class="container mx-auto my-6 rounded border border-black bg-white p-4">
      <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-red-800">Goals</h2>
      <h3 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Goal 1: Understand the capabilities of LLMs through reading and summarizing technical papers.</h3>
      <p>I've gained a solid grasp of how Large Language Models (LLMs) work by reading and summarizing technical papers. This Co-op at the University of Guelph involved reviewing literature on educational chatbots, which helped me understand LLMs and their applications in computer science education.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Goal 2: Design and build a chatbot that uses an LLM.</h3>
      <p>I now have hands-on experience in designing and building chatbots with LLMs. I created a chatbot using TypeScript, React, and Express.js, and integrated it with the Google Gemini API. This enhanced the chatbot’s ability to help students with coding assignments by providing feedback.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Goal 3: Collect, organize, and process data from the chatbot.</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, I was not able to collect, organize, and process data from the chatbot due to some roadblocks encountered during the project.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Goal 4: Write a Technical / Developer Report</h3>
      <p>I wrote a research paper titled "Chat With Socs1300Sensei! The hurdles of developing a Chatbot with an LLM for Intro to Programming Course," which added to the academic discussion on educational chatbots and also improved my writing abilities.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section class="container mx-auto my-6 rounded border border-black bg-white p-4">
      <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-red-800">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In summary, I’ve developed strong skills in working with LLMs, designing chatbots, analyzing data, and writing technical reports. I’ve applied these skills in projects like creating an educational chatbot and writing a research paper, which expanded my knowledge and contributed to the field. These skills will be invaluable in my future endeavors.</p>
